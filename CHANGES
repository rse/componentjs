    Changes
    =======

    This is a list of MAJOR changes to ComponentJS. For a
    more fine-granular commit-based change information,
    have a look at the version control history under
    https://github.com/rse/componentjs/commits/master

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.4.2 and 1.4.3
    -------------------------------------------------

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Be more descriptive in debug messages related to the dispatching
      of events to subscribers.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Improve rendering of testdrive plugin dialog in SPAs which change
      CSS "box-sizing" at the top-level (as Bootstrap-based SPAs do) by
      enforcing "box-sizing: content-box" in the displayed testdrive
      dialog. Also enforce "white-space: nowrap" on the "Identifier"
      column.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.4.1 and 1.4.2
    -------------------------------------------------

    o ADDITION:
      Added to the Vue plugin the functionality of generating Vue
      trampoline methods for all utility methods named "utilXXX" in the
      ComponentJS (view) component backing objects. They can be used for
      complex checks or calculations in the Vue data-binding.

    o ADDITION:
      Added detailed functionality documentation to the top
      of the Vue plugin.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.4.0 and 1.4.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Vue plugin: allow values to be set in event binding
      by using "eventFooBar(value)" instead of just "eventFooBar".

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Vue plugin: switch from Vue recognized 'ref="socketFoo"' to
      standard non-Vue 'data-socket="foo"' and use the new freedom
      by supporting a "[<name>][@<scope>]" syntax for the socket
      auto-generation mechanism.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.3.1 and 1.4.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Fixed height of console and infobox parts in ComponentJS debugger.
      Removed duplicated CSS styles in ComponentJS debugger.
      Changed CSS appearance of all ComponentJS debugger buttons.
      Set overflow only to overflow-y in ComponentJS debugger.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Changed ComponentJS debugger infobox output to sort model values.
      Added filter to console list in ComponentJS debugger.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Throw an error when a clazz or trait tries to define a static
      or dynamic field with the name of one of the defined life-cycle
      enter/leave methods.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.3.0 and 1.3.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Fix default socket handling in Vue plugin.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.2.7 and 1.3.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      The "op" parameter of method value() accepted an empty string
      which is not valid.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Revamped values plugin (component.plugin.values.js): no more
      caching (as it can make trouble), use correct owner component, use
      the internal .data sub-field.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Upgraded all build environment dependencies.

    o ADDITION:
      Added a Vue.js plugin (component.plugin.vue.js).

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.2.6 and 1.2.7
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Pass-through arguments in internal intermediate/auto-generated
      "this.base()" trampoline methods and always annotate those methods
      with the intended name. This allows mixins to correctly call
      "this.base(arg)" and get "arg" to be correctly passed to a base
      function in the inheritance chain of the class the mixin is mixed
      into.

    o BUGFIX:
      Add missing documentation for publish() parameters.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Update all build-time dependencies.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Update all build-time dependencies.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.2.5 and 1.2.6
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Aligned versions between NPM package.json and VERSION file.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.2.4 and 1.2.5
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Fix special case for clazz/trait functionality: in case a mixin
      with function exists, a target class has no such function, but
      in inheritance chain a function exists, then a dummy function
      calling "this.base()" has to be provided in the target class to
      not interrupt the base resolving process.

    o BUGFIX:
      Internet Explorer chokes on many characters in the debugger window
      title, so in IE we finally replace all characters in the title
      which potentially could lead to problems.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Update all build-time dependencies.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.2.3 and 1.2.4
    -------------------------------------------------

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      As NPM also becomes popular for shipping client-side code, ship
      ComponentJS under name "componentjs" via both Bower and NPM now.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.2.2 and 1.2.3
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      fix viewing of "Model" components in the debugger where
      the model items were not correctly displayed.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      provide platform independent alternative to Unix Makefile by
      leveraging NPM scripts which have node_modules/.bin/ in PATH

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.2.1 and 1.2.2
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Once again fix edge cases of the class/trait system
      and the rather complex resolving of "this.base()" in traits.

    o BUGFIX:
      Switch embedded Thenable.js from minified to original version to
      circumvent JSHint trouble during compilation time.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.2.0 and 1.2.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Update build-time dependencies and remove the use of the now
      obsolete Grunt task "grunt-extend-config".

    o BUGFIX:
      Fixed "wait" parameter of testdrive#poll() for the case of a
      passed number instead of a function.

    o BUGFIX:
      The resolving order of Clazz/Trait was fixed.

    o BUGFIX:
      The traversal of Clazz/Trait on "this.base()" calls was fixed.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.1.1 and 1.2.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Renamed the second argument of state() from "callback" to just
      "func" to be aligned with all other callback parameters in the
      API. This is just an incompatibility if state() is called with
      named parameters, not if state() is called with positional
      parameters.

    o ADDITION:
      Added new parameter "boot" (boolean) to method observe() which
      allows one to once execute the callback function (and only the
      callback function and no other callback functions of other
      observers).

    o ADDITION:
      Added new "testdrive" plugin which provides a use-case based
      suite of tests for test-driving an application through bare state
      transitions and model manipulations.

    o ADDITION:
      Added "noevent" parameter to observe() which (similar to
      "noevent" on subscribe()) prevents the event to be passed as
      first argument to the callback function.

    o ADDITION:
      Provide internal hooks "ComponentJS:state-enter" and
      "ComponentJS:state-leave" to plugins.

    o ADDITION:
      Method state() now supports the additional optional parameters
      "min" and "max" for conveniently refining the transition request.

    o BUGFIX:
      On .create() enter the first user-defined state (on top of "dead")
      instead of the hard-coded "created" state.

    o BUGFIX:
      Implement the internally published events "ComponentJS:state:<name>:enter"
      and "ComponentJS:state:<name>:leave" the way they were documented.

    o BUGFIX:
      Prevent errors in debugger in case the subscription is not a
      string (but perhaps a RegExp)

    o BUGFIX:
      Fix debugger's "click on component and show infobox" functionality
      under Firefox and similar browers (where an Event has no
      .offsetX/Y but .layerX/Y and .clientX/Y properties).

    o BUGFIX:
      fix description of parameter "touch" of method observe().

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.1.0 and 1.1.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Fixed .base() method for inheritance chaining situations
      with more than one parent class.

    o BUGFIX:
      Fixed the build-time substitution for the ComponentJS
      version information in the API.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.0.1 and 1.1.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Allow empty "protos" fields in clazz() and trait() methods.

    o BUGFIX:
      Support "@: type" validation notation also in subsetting cases.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Replaced the HTML API documentation generator component-api.pl
      (Perl script) with component-api.js (JavaScript script) to have
      even less external dependencies.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Major Build Environment Refactoring: switched from plain Unix
      make(1) to Grunt.

    o ADDITION:
      Added (API exposed) utility select() method for selecting values
      from arbitrary structured object graphs.

    o ADDITION:
      Added support for validating a value against a subset of the type
      specification.

    o ADDITION:
      Added support for manipulating and observing arbitrary structured
      model values.

    o ADDITION:
      Added "def" (default value) option to method property()
      to simplify application code.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Removed API methods "subscription" and "registration" as they
      are effectively useless for application code and only useful
      for ComponentJS internals. They should never have been used
      in any application, as it is not necessary to remember a
      subscription/registration id and to explicitly check whether it is
      still active.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Renamed the observe() option "operation" to just "op" as the
      name "operation" is really too long and we want to also use
      the more concise "op" for value(), etc.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Rename attribute() option "validate" to "valid" to be more in sync
      with similar options of other methods.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      For params() use the new validate() functionality (which now also
      supports RegExp and functions) only.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      params() now validates already the default value of a parameter
      against its validation specification.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      renamed the name of the only argument of model() from "model" to
      "spec" to be in sync with the documentation. This is harmless, because
      one usually always use the argument in positional variant only.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Refactored models created by model() into a read-only specification
      and separate data. This allows forthcoming plugins to directly
      access the model data more easily.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Remove an undocumented feature: the model() method no longer
      returns the (old) model and no longer can be called without any
      arguments (to just retrieve the model).

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.0.1 and 1.0.2
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Cherry-picked and back-ported all major bugfixes from the
      ComponentJS development branch.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.0.0 and 1.0.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o ADDITION:
      add an "enabled" state on top of visible for those
      situations where we want to show a UI but still keep it disabled.

    o BUGFIX:
      correctly tear down the component tree in shutdown()
      as the root component cannot be directly destroyed.

    o BUGFIX:
      fix syntax of TypeScript type definition file "component.d.ts".

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      document "clazz" behavior better in the API documentation.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.9 and 1.0.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Removed the "async" option on register() as it never worked
      and was a wrong design idea anyway.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      On publishing events the "spreading" option no longer defaults to
      "true" in order to improve performance in standard cases.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Improve build process: provide a "stage0" target which does not
      need any special tools beside "perl" and "shtool" in order to allow
      developers under Windows to participate more easily.

    o ADDITION:
      Added "targeting" (boolean) option to plug() / unplug() and this
      way indirectly fix the semantic of link() in case a target should
      link onto itself.

    o ADDITION:
      Added "scope" (string) option to property() to allow a more
      convenient way to scope a property instead of the special
      "name@scope" syntax of the "name" option.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      In the debugger, prepend log messages instead of appending them
      as this is a lot more convenient during debugging.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Added necessary hooks for companion project "componentjs-tracing",
      to allow easier instrumentation of ComponentJS based applications.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Improved and updated TypeScript definition for newer TypeScript
      0.9 world order (where "bool" is not "boolean", etc).

    o BUGFIX:
      Skip not-enumerable fields and the special fields "constructor"
      and "prototype" on object/hash validation.

    o BUGFIX:
      Fixed internal cloning of Array objects (which is
      used for the "dynamics" part of cs.clazz!).

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Improve the internal JSON encoder to more correctly detect cycles.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Allow also "null" as an identifier to validate against the special
      Object null.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Allow application to still enforce standard sockets by skipping
      the jQuery/ExtJS inference if no 'type' parameter is given.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.8 and 0.9.9
    -------------------------------------------------

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Switch code-base to latest JSHint.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Improve API documentation.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Reduced the external build-time dependencies.

    o BUGFIX:
      Bugfix cs.params() function and add additional hook
      for plugins to cs.params().

    o ADDITION:
      Provide "this.result" (the current aggregated result)
      and "this.hooks" (the total number of registered hooks)
      to the internal hooking mechanism to allow plugins to
      leverage from more information.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Reduce the number of redundant internal annotation calls
      in the central clazz/trait mechanism.

    o BUGFIX:
      Cleanup all internal "cs.params()" usages by using either
      "req" or "def" but never both in parallel (as it makes no sense).

    o ADDITION:
      Allow all "spool" parameters to use the syntax
      "<comp-path>:<spool-name>" in addition to the standard
      "<spool-name>" in order to use the spool of component, addressed
      via the relative path "<comp-path>".

    o BUGFIX:
      Sockets created with socket()/link() can be not destroyed
      with unsocket()/unlink()

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.7 and 0.9.8
    -------------------------------------------------

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Improved Debugger plugin: the components in the component tree
      view are now clickable. Once clicked details about the component
      are displayed in the new infobox view which overlays the console
      view. Additionally, the component tree view now provides a zoom
      and scroll functionality in order to allow you to display large
      component trees in a reasonable way, too.

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Modularized the debugger plugin sources.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      The localStorage persistence functionality of models is now
      in a dedicated plugin (component.plugin.localstorage.js) because
      the localStorage functionality is not available everywhere
      (e.g. not in NodeJS head-less testing situations, etc).

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.6 and 0.9.7
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGIX:
      Fixed internal "clazz" parameter validation.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.5 and 0.9.6
    -------------------------------------------------

    o IMPROVEMENT:
      Improved Debugger plugin: the status bar is now grabbable
      to allow you to more precisely control the size of the component
      tree visual display. The background of the visual display, header
      and status bar are now gradient based. Active state transition
      guards are now indicated by partially-overlayed red light bulps
      (rendered only if guards are not at level 0).

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      <component>.subscribe({ origin: true, ... }) functionality was
      removed as the Event object on callbacks has the origin via its
      <ev>.target() method.

    o BUGFIX:
      fixed "exclusive" subcription handling.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.4 and 0.9.5
    -------------------------------------------------

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Replaced the object validation mechanism of cs.params() and
      cs.model() with a full-blown DSL-based implementation. The most
      notably changes are that a "null" value now matches the type
      "object". Upgrade your source: "array(foo)" is now "[foo*]"

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.3 and 0.9.4
    -------------------------------------------------

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      The 4th argument (DOCUMENT) for ComponentJS.plugin() is now gone.
      Plugins should not need it anyway.

    o ADDITION:
      Additional internal hooks are provided for plugins.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Model default values are initially validated, too.

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      The <script data-symbol="<name>" [...]> functionality
      was removed as it conflicts with the plugin mechanism.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.2 and 0.9.3
    -------------------------------------------------

    o INCOMPATIBILITY:
      Refactored out the debugger into its own plugin.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.1 and 0.9.2
    -------------------------------------------------

    o BUGFIX:
      Added back support for Internet Explorer 8 where a field
      cannot be named "constructor". The cs.clazz/cs.trait field
      is now named "cons".

    o ADDITION:
      Added an additional "configured" state which can be used
      to configure subscribe/register/observe/latch operations
      while "prepare" is still intended for loading data.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.0 and 0.9.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o ADDITION:
      Implemented an internal hooking and plugin mechanism and
      provided two convenient plugins for jQuery and Ext socket support.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.0.0 and 0.9.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Initial functionality
